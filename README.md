# Scientist Rankings

This project analyses a dataset of scientists and their impact rankings based on their publications and citations.

It evaluates the use of machine learning to predict the rankings and introduces a method to generate personalized recommendations for improving the ranking.

All code is located in the scientist_rankings.ipynb. You can clone the project and run the notebook to recreate the results. (There might be minor differences caused by the random generator.)
